# HOUSE RULES
Social Event Planner and Finder

Android app that allows users to create events (Parties, Game Nights, Movie Nights)
Uses Google maps api so you can set the location of the event
Users need an account(can log in through fb) or create an account
Users can rate each event after they check in, leading to a User overall rating
Send invites and create events, of which can be public/private
Add chat system
This allows strangers who want to go to the party or are invited to know what the vibe is gonna be like there. You can leave reviews almost like yelp, so if there is a high uncomfortability for women or men they know that that person is sketch.
Notifications for events within
You can also post the rules for the games at the party, like say you have BP at the party you can post pong rules, For example the island rule differs at multiple houses so if you have the rules on your phone leads to less arguments.

We also want to do an invite system so we can send out invites where admins of the party can send out invites both priority (VIP) and basic invites. You can host public and private events, but no matter what the guest must request an invitation so if they see a party is poppin they still must use the app to get in. They check in automatically when they walk in the house so you also have a head count in the house making regulation easier. Also get to put people on probation so if they step in the house you are alerted, so if a guy spams the invitation 6 times he gets put on probation

As a dj you could be listed and reviewed so people can follow which parties you are going to be at throughout the weeks. You can follow underground artists this way which makes everyone's partying experience here a lot safer and more towards you.

Calling it House Rules because it all revolves around the uniqueness of each House party
